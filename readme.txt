Game designer: Justin Farr
Players: 1
Time: ~10 minutes (depends on what lurks in the shadows!)

I started developing this game because I really enjoy playing table top board games, however,
sometimes it's hard to find people to play with. This game is a work in progress so please feel
free to send suggestions my way.

You can read the initial story here: soliterror.com

Thank you for playing.


Justin has been Running wild since 1977.
