				<p>SoliTerror is a quick thematic horror adventure game for 1 player. You can enjoy this game using a regular deck of cards.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Designer: Justin Farr<br>
				Players: 1<br>
				Time: 10 min. (or less if the monsters are really angry)</p>

			<p>Some eerie and sinister kinds of things have been happening on your small rural farm over the past couple weeks. Animals have either gone missing or been found ripped apart and partially eaten. Unearthly groans and noises sound off in the shadows. Someone or something has kidnapped and trapped your family in some kind cave you've never seen before. This cave is across one of your fields and you must make it across to rescue each of your family members. Along the way, you’ll be collecting food, medical supplies, and weapons… but watch out! There are monsters lurking in the tall grass!</p>
			<p>To win the game, you must rescue each family member and then have enough food at the end of the game to survive.</p>
		</div><!-- ///////////////////// SETUP ////////////////////// -->
		<div>
			<h2>SETUP</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>First remove all the royalty cards (Jack, Queen, King) from the hearts, diamonds, and spades. Keep all the royalty cards for the clubs.</li>
				<li>Next, lay out the 4 Aces in a horizontal line - these are the caves your family is trapped in!</li>
				<li>Shuffle the remaining cards and randomly line up 4 cards (face down) vertically under each Ace - this will create your field.</li>
				<li>Then place one random card (face down) to the bottom right of the field. This card will remain face down and serve as your "Last Breath". This area will be considered your health kit.</li>
				<li>Finally, deal yourself 7 cards and lay the remainder of the cards in a draw deck to the left side of the field.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now you’re ready to begin!</p>
			<h2>Legend for the different types of cards</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Hearts = Health/medical supplies</li>
				<li>Diamonds = Food</li>
				<li>Spades = Weapons</li>
				<li>Clubs = Monsters</li>
				<li>Joker = Flare Gun</li>
			</ul>
		</div><!-- ///////////////////// BEGIN ////////////////////// -->
		<div>
			<h2>BEGIN.</h2>
			<h3>Sort your seven starting cards as follows:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If it is a monster card (club), you can discard it (Woohoo! You won’t have to fight those!)</li>
				<li>If it is a weapon card (spade), keep it in hand or in front of you. This will be your arsenal.</li>
				<li>If it is a health/medical card (heart), place it face-up on top of your "Last Breath" card - This will be your health kit.</li>
				<li>If it is a food card (diamond), place it to the right of the field just above your health kit - this will be your food supply.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Place your character marker on any path you’d like.</p>
		</div><!-- ///////////////////// TURNS ////////////////////// -->
		<div>
			<h2>TURNS.</h2>
			<p>Each turn consists of three basic actions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Call For Help</strong>: Reveal &amp; resolve the top card from the draw deck</li>
				<li><strong>Move Character</strong>: Move character marker forward</li>
				<li><strong>Explore Field</strong>: Reveal &amp; resolve the field card that you just exited</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>1. Call For Help</h3>
			<h4>Turn over one card from the draw deck and place it next to the field. This card is considered active.</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>If it is a weapon, you may immediately take it into your arsenal</li>
				<li>If it is food, you may immediately place it in your food supply</li>
				<li>If it is health/medical you may immediately place it in your health kit</li>
				<li>If it is a monster, you must assess it then kill it or swap it (See Killing monsters section)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>2. Move Character</h3>
			<h4>Once you have resolved the active card from the draw deck, move your character marker up the path one card.</h4>
			<h3>3. Explore Field</h3>
			<h4>Reveal the card that your character marker just left. You must now deal with the revealed card.</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>If it is food, you may trade one health/medical if you want it (1:1 ratio no matter what the value is). Discard the health/medical and add the food to your supply. NOTE: 2, 3, and 4 value food cards are free to take.</li>
				<li>If it is a health/medical card, you may immediately place that card in your health kit.</li>
				<li>If it is a weapon, you may trade food from your food supply for it. The value of the food must be equal or higher in value. You may use more than one food card if necessary. You do not get change. Discard the food card(s) and place the weapon in your arsenal. NOTE: 2, 3, and 4 value weapon cards are free to take.</li>
				<li>If it is a monster card, you must assess and attack it. (See Killing monsters section)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Rescuing a family member</h2>
			<p>When you resolve the last card in the row, you have rescued a family member!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Place the rescued member next to your health kit. They are now considered safe.</li>
				<li>Reveal the next 3 cards from the draw deck.</li>
				<li>If it is a weapon, you may immediately take it into your arsenal.</li>
				<li>If it is food, you may immediately place it in your food supply</li>
				<li>If it is health/medical you may immediately place it in your health kit.</li>
				<li>If it is a monster, discard it! (You won’t need to fight it)</li>
				<li>Place your character marker on any new path and begin your turns again.</li>
			</ul>
		</div><!-- ///////////////////// KILLING MONSTERS /////////////////////// -->
		<div>
			<h2>Killing monsters</h2>
			<p>You will encounter monsters in one of two ways, either 1). in the field or 2). from the draw deck. Any time you encounter a monster you must first assess and then attack.</p>
			<p>Assessing the monster: If the monster is a 6 or higher, you immediately take away one health/medical card and then attempt to attack.</p>
			<p>The various ways to attack the monsters are listed below.</p>
			<div style="margin-left: 2em">
				<h3>1) To Kill monsters in the field</h3>
				<h4>There are four ways to kill monsters encountered in the field:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Weapon of equal or greater value</li>
					<li>2 of any weapon + 1 health/medical</li>
					<li>Set of any 3 sequential weapons (i.e. 3, 4, 5)</li>
					<li>Any 3 health/medical cards</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>2) To Kill monsters from the draw deck</h3>
				<h4>There are a few ways to kill monsters from the draw deck</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Any of the four ways used to kill monsters in the field</li>
					<li>Discard one health/medical card</li>
					<li>Trade out the monster for any card in the field of your choice (discard the card from the field)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div><!-- ///////////////////// THE FLARE GUN /////////////////////// -->
		<div>
			<h2>The Flare Gun</h2>
			<p>The flare gun is used to kill a monster and reveal all the cards adjacent to it (orthogonal &amp; diagonal). Once you reveal and acquire the Flare Gun, you may add it to your arsenal and use it <em>only once</em> during the game when fighting a monster in the field.</p>
			<p>The Flare Gun kills the monster immediately and all the other revealed cards remain in place. Seeing these other cards will help you strategize your next moves!</p>
		</div><!-- ///////////////////// END ///////////////////////////////////// -->
		<div>
			<h2>END.</h2>
			<h3>The game is over when you either DIE or rescue all of your family members</h3>
			<h4>Conditions for loosing:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>You die when you have 0 health left and then get attacked by a monster. NOTE: You can still survive without any health, but if you get attacked when you have 0 health and cannot fight off the monster, then you die... and lose the game.</li>
				<li>You also lose the game if you do not have enough food cards for each family member including yourself.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Condition for winning:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>To win the game, you must reach each family member and have at least one food card per member including you. (So 5 total food cards)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
			<p>If you cannot afford to trade for a revealed weapon, it must remain on the field. If you land next to that weapon later in the game (horizontally), you may purchase the weapon at that time if you have enough food for trade.</p>
			<h2>Variations</h2>
			<h4>For a little more challenging game, try one (or a combination) of these variations:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Skip the three card draw after the rescue of family members</li>
				<li>Don’t include the Flare Gun</li>
				<li>Mix the family members into the field cards and add the ability to move one card in any direction as long as the cards are touching. Don’t accidentally cut a family member off from being rescued!</li>
			</ul>
