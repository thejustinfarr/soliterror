		<div>
			<p>It has been 8 months since 'the shift' happened. I've been fortunate enough to get my family away from the coasts and heavily populated areas. We came across an abondoned farm tucked away in the hills of Missouri and we've been fortifiying it for the past two months.</p>

			<p>It seems as if a lot of people passed through here quickly when the shift first happened - we're still finding stashes of medical supplies, food, and even weapons.</p>

			<p>And just in case you're not familiar with what, 'The Shift' is... that's what we're starting to call the event which happened back in the fall of 2018. That's when the tectonic plates shifted - and continue to do so - along the coasts of the world. It's causing earthquakes, tsunamis, and other unexplicalble (supernatural-like) phenomenon.</p>

			<br>
			<div><h2>3 Weeks Ago...</h2></div>

			<p>I came across a network of caves in the north forest. I mentioned thme to my family and made it clear that that area and any caves were off limits.</p>

			<br>
			<div><h2>1 Week Ago...</h2></div>

			<p>Some eerie and sinister kinds of things have been happening lately... Animals have either gone missing or been found ripped apart and partially eaten. Unearthly groans and noises sound off in the shadows.</p>

			<br>
			<div><h2>1 Day Ago...</h2></div>

			<p>Someone or something has kidnapped and trapped my family in the caves out in the forest.</p>

			<br>
			<div><h2>Back To Present Day...</h2></div>

			<p>I must navigate the forest and caves to rescue each of my family members. I'll be collecting any food, medical supplies, and weapons along the way. I must kill whatever those things are that are out there... if they don't kill me first...</p>
