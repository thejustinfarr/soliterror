			<p>Some eerie and sinister kinds of things have been happening on your small rural farm over the past couple weeks. Animals have either gone missing or been found ripped apart and partially eaten. Unearthly groans and noises sound off in the shadows. Someone or something has kidnapped and trapped your family in some kind cave you've never seen before. This cave is across one of your fields and you must make it across to rescue each of your family members. Along the way, you’ll be collecting food, medical supplies, and weapons… but watch out! There are monsters lurking in the tall grass!</p>
			<p>To win the game, you must rescue each family member and then have enough food at the end of the game to survive.</p>
